For the Munich based beer brewing company Broy Gmbh I engaged in multiple projects advertising the brand and bringing the product to the customer.

## Beer Delivery App

The main project was the development of a mobile app for iOS and Android. The app is used by the customer to order beer to a specific location withing a delivery boundary. The employees of the company then delivered freshly tap beer directly to the selected location. The app is built with React Native and uses Mapbox for the map view. The backend is built with AWS Amplify.
