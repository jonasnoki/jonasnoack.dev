During my studies I worked with the startup Normcut. Their focus is on reducing waste in industrial cutting processes. With them I developed a plugin for the CAD software Rhino, an interactive landing page and a frontend for their demand management system. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS. The backend is built with .Net and C#.
